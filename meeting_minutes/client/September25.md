## Minutes
45 Minutes

### Discussion
1. Alternative of Jeliot.
	* We have finalize the integration of the other Java Visualization tool that runs on a webpage.
2. How to make use of both the debuggers.
	* It was decided that since the JNLP file downloads the whole Jeliot debugger whenever it is launched, this option is only suitable for consumers having high internet bandwidth. So instead of confusing the consumers by giving access to both the debuggers, it was decided that the site should serve the Jeliot debugger only to the consumer having high internet bandwidth while consumers having low bandwidth, will be redirected to the online visualizing tool.
3. We solely need to concentrate on integrating different debuggers and making a proper learning environment for the consumer.

### Action Points
1. Test the newly found Java Visualizer with the existing java codes present on the course portal.
2. Check if there are plugins of moodle or web based solution which can help detect the consumer's internet bandwidth.
3. Taking help of Suresh Sir and Mr. Andres Moreno, fix the remaining problems in the jeliot plugin.
