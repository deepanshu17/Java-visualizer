## Agenda
To report our progress, discuss issues and finalize requirements.

## Minutes
45 Minutes

### Discussion
1. About Jeliot integration.
	* Jeliot can not be integrated with moodle and cannot run on a Webpage or a server port.
2. Alternative of Jeliot.
	* We have found a Java Visualization tool that runs on a webpage and can be integrated with Moodle.
3. Discuss final requirement
	* It was decided that app development is not to be pursued. Concentrate on finding more alternatives and try to find exceptions and limits to the newly found online java visualization tool, and then integrating it to the Moodle platform. Jeliot will remain as an option for the student to visualize code outside of the browser via the fixed plugin.

### Action Points
1. Find and exhaust all alternatives of Jeliot i.e. Java Visualization tool which can be integrated in a webpage.
2. Test the newly found Java Visualizer with the existing java codes present on the course portal.
