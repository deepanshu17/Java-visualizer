	* Show the demo of Jeliot (Java Visual Debugger) working on Windows, which we fixed this week.
2. What problems are remaining.
	* On Windows, accessing the course which has Jeliot plugin in it, throws an error "Invalid query parameters Expected 2
	  got 0. "
	* On Linux, upon opening the generated JNLP file throws Parsing Error.
